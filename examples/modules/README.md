# Module Examples

Runnable examples for the companion modules under [`/modules`](../../modules/). Each subdirectory contains a `main.tf` and a `config/` tree with sample YAML.

These examples use a **local source path** (`source = "../../../modules/<name>"`) so they can be `terraform init`-ed and validated without fetching from GitHub. Real consumers should use the Git source documented in each module's README:

```hcl
source = "git::https://github.com/macadmins/terraform-provider-googleworkspace.git//modules/<name>?ref=v1.5.0"
```

## Examples
